# Multiple Regression

## Resources

[Slides](slides/02_multreg/index.html)

My textbook chapter on [multiple regression](https://psyteachr.github.io/stat-models-v1/multiple-regression.html) covers a lot of the material in greater depth.

## Activity

For this set of exercises, you're going to be working with some real data collected about students from a previous year of student in statistics at the University of Glasgow. The data have been anonymized, and no demographic or other sensitive information has been provided. Each student is identified by a unique value of the variable `id`.

Students were given the STats Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS), a 51-item questionnaire which measures student's attitudes toward statistics [@cruise1985]. For each item, students are asked to rate either agreement with a statement on a 1 to 5 scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree), or rate how anxious they would feel on a 1 to 5 scale (1 = no anxiety, 5 = strong anxiety). Higher numbers mean more anxiety or more negative attitudes toward statistics.  If you're interested, you can see the individual survey items below.

`r unhide()`

The STARS items can be divided up into six different subscales [@hanna2008], which reflect different aspects of statistics training that students may feel anxiety toward: Asking For Help, Interpretation, Self Concept, Teacher, Test, and (Self-)Worth.

Students in this course were allowed to freely choose what software they used to perform the class assignments, either SPSS or R.

The data is in the file [stars-wide.csv](data/stars-wide.csv){target="_download"}

Your task is to use multiple regression examine the relationship between the stats anxiety subscales and overall performance in the class, as measured by the students' final grades.

## Tasks

Open up a new RMarkdown file and create separate code chunks for each of the following tasks. Alternatively, you can write your code into an R script and mark each task using comments.


### Import the data

:::{.try}

You will need to use the **`tidyverse`** package as well as the **`corrr`** package. Load in those packages and then import `stars-wide.csv`. You might want to look at the [Data Import Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf){target="_blank"}.

```{r data-import, webex.hide="solution", message = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("corrr")

stars <- read_csv("data/stars-wide.csv",
                  col_types = "iiddddddc")

## remember to look at your data before proceeding!
stars
```
:::

### Create a correlation matrix

:::{.try}

Create a correlation matrix using `corrr::correlate()` showing the bivariate correlation between your response variable (`grade`) and the six subscale means.

`r hide("hint")`

Select the variables that you need and then use `correlate()` from the `corrr` package.

`r unhide()`

```{r corr-mx, webex.hide="solution"}
stars %>%
  select(-id, -software) %>%
  correlate() %>%
  shave(upper = TRUE) %>%
  fashion() %>%
  knitr::kable(align = "r")
```

:::

### Visualize all pairwise correlations

:::{.try}

Now visualize all of the pairwise correlations.

`r hide("hint")`

Use `pairs()`. See `?pairs` for help and examples.

`r unhide()`

```{r pairs, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, webex.hide="solution"}
stars %>%
  select(-id, -software) %>%
  pairs()
```

:::

### Run the multiple regression

:::{.try}

Estimate the parameters for the multiple regression, with grade as the response variable and the subscale means as the predictors. Don't forget to display your results using `summary()`, and take a moment to think about what all the numbers mean.

`r hide("hint")`

`lm(dv ~ iv1 + iv2 + ..., data = ???)`

`r unhide()`

```{r fit-model, webex.hide="solution"}
model <- lm(grade ~ Ask_For_Help + Interpretation + Self_Concept +
              Teacher + Test + Worth,
            data = stars)

summary(model)
```
:::

### Which subscale is the 'best' predictor?

:::{.try}

Is there one subscale that is more strongly linked to the final grade? The different subscales have different variances, so you need to re-run the regression after standardizing the variables.

`r hide("hint")`

calculate z-scores for each predictor; in tidyverse you can do this using

```
stars %>%
  mutate(zx = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x),
         zy = (y - mean(y)) / sd(y), ... etc)
```

`r unhide()`

```{r zscores, webex.hide="solution"}
## two ways to do this:
## 1. just type it all out
zscores1 <- stars %>%
  mutate(Ask_For_Help = (Ask_For_Help - mean(Ask_For_Help)) / sd(Ask_For_Help),
         Interpretation = (Interpretation - mean(Interpretation)) / sd(Interpretation),
         Self_Concept = (Self_Concept - mean(Self_Concept)) / sd(Self_Concept),
         Teacher = (Teacher - mean(Teacher)) / sd(Teacher),
         Test = (Test - mean(Test)) / sd(Test),
         Worth = (Worth - mean(Worth)) / sd(Worth))

## 2 (advanced). use 'scoping' variant of mutate; see ?mutate_at
zscores1 <- stars %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-id, -grade, -software), ~ (.x - mean(.x)) / sd(.x))

model_z <- lm(grade ~ Ask_For_Help + Interpretation + Self_Concept +
                Teacher + Test + Worth,
              data = zscores1)

summary(model_z)
```
:::

### Compare models

:::{.try}

Could we do just as well predicting grades from the 'best' predictor as we could by including all six subscale predictors? Do an analysis to test this.

`r hide("hint")`

Fit two models and compare using `anova()`

`r unhide()`

```{r self-concept, webex.hide="solution"}
## we are doing it with the standardized scores;
## could also do it using the unstandardized scores and would get the same result
sc_only <- lm(grade ~ Self_Concept, zscores1)

anova(sc_only, model_z)
## no evidence for improvement by adding other 5 predictors!

summary(sc_only)
```

:::

### Choice of software and grade

:::{.try}

Run a simple regression that predicts grades by choice of software (SPSS versus R).

```{r grade-by-software, webex.hide="solution"}
model_gxs <- lm(grade ~ software, stars)

summary(model_gxs)
```
