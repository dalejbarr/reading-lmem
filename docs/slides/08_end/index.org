* Generalized Linear (Mixed) Models

*** Discrete data

- categorical (dichotomous/polychotomous)
  - type of linguistic structure produced (X, Y, Z)
  - region viewed in a visual world study
  - number of items recalled out of N
  - accurate or inaccurate selection
  - hired or not hired
  - Likert scales

- counts (no. opportunities ill-defined)
  - no. of speech errors in a corpus
  - no. of turn shifts in a conversation
  - no. words in a utterance

*** Why not treat discrete data as continuous?

- Proportions range between 0 and 1
- Variance proportional to the mean (expected probability or rate)
- Spurious interactions due to scaling effects

*** Generalized linear models

- Allows use of regular linear regression by projecting the DV onto an
  appropriate scale

- Key elements of GLMs: 
  - link function
  - variance function

** Logistic regression

*** Odds and log odds

#+begin_smalltbl

| *Bernoulli trial* | An event that has a binary outcome, with one outcome typically referred to as 'success'                                             |
| *proportion*      | A ratio of successes to the total number of Bernoulli trials, proportion of days of the week that are Wednesday is 1/7 or about .14 |
| *odds*            | A ratio of successes to non-successes, i.e., odds of a day being Wednesday are 1 to 6, natural odds= 1/6 = .17                      |
| *log odds*        | The (natural) log of the odds (turns multiplicative effects into additive effects)                                                  |

*** Logit app

[[https://shiny.psy.gla.ac.uk/Dale/logit]]

*** Estimating logit models

- single-level data, bernoulli trials
  : mod <- glm(DV ~ IV, family = binomial(link = "logit"), ...)

- single-level data, binomial counts
  : mod <- glm(cbind(Y, K) ~ IV, family = binomial(link = "logit"), ...)
  where K = N - Y

- multi-level data: same, but use =lme4::glmer()=

* Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs)

** What are GAMMs?

[[file:GAMMs.png]]

(courtesy Márton Sóskuthy)
- for SL data, fit using =mgcv::gam()=
- for ML data, fit using =mgcv::bam()=

** How to fit GAMMs?

You can fit LMMs with GAMM functions.

ML data with within-factor A (A1, A2) and between-factor B (B1, B2)

#+begin_src R :exports code :eval never
  mgcv::bam(Y ~ A * B +
	      s(subj_id, bs = "re") +
	      s(subj_id, A, bs = "re"),
	    data = dat)

  lme4::lmer(Y ~ A * B +
	       (1 | subj_id) +
	       (0 + A | subj_id),
	     data = dat)
#+end_src

** Fitting wiggly patterns

#+begin_src R :exports code :eval never
  mgcv::bam(Y ~ A * B +
	      ## wiggly main effect of tnum
	      s(tnum, bs = "tp") +
	      ## "factor smooth"
	      s(subj_id, tnum, bs = "fs") + 
	      s(subj_id, A, bs = "re"),
	    data = dat)

** A word about temporal autocorrelation

If you randomized, you are probably OK; the worst you can expect is a mild hit to power.
